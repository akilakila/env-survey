# env-survey
This is a webpage designed to take in user information via survey format and provide results on where they lie on an "environmentally friendly spectrum."

It then allows for the option for users to redirect themselves to a page that provides more information on the environment.

# Instructions for backend team

First, open your terminal to where the files are
Then, with your terminal, type in python3 algo.py to run the python file
Now, on your browser, go to:  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Now, you're all set up for checking what the python algorithm has to offer
Although, it might be better to create a test dictionary, then practice
Reloading and doing the survey is gonna be super tedious
